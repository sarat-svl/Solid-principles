| Principle | Concept |
| --- | --- |
| **S**ingle Responsibility | A class should have only **one reason to change** |
| **O**pen/Closed | Code should be **open for extension, closed for modification** |
| **L**iskov Substitution | Subclasses should be **replaceable** for their base class |
| **I**nterface Segregation | Donâ€™t force classes to **implement unused methods** |
| **D**ependency Inversion | Depend on **abstractions, not concrete implementations** |
